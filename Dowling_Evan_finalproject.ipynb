    "### Introduction\n",
    "For most physics students hoping to get into graduate school, they often wonder what it takes for them to get into certain programs. Luckily a back in 2009 a website, www.physicsgre.com, created a forum where its viewers could post their academic profile and update where they got accepted and rejected. Since then a new forum has been created every year where students update where they have been accepted and rejected. With 10 years of data on the website I have yet to find accumulated statistics of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to scrape all the data on the website and analyze its trends. We want to determine what is the strongest indicator to get accepted into the nations top 25 programs: GPA, certain test scores, etc. And how do scores and acceptances vary across different populations of people: men, women, domestic, international, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also because Maryland made the list it would be interesting to see how the University of Maryland compares to its competitors. \n",

Female. I have 6 eager recommenders and have encountered a number of cosmologists hearing good things about me from other scientists before meeting me, so I have little doubt that LORs will be my biggest strength. A few faculty at the schools I'm applying to have mentioned \"putting in a word on my behalf\" to the admissions committee.\n",

What was good, though, was that I emailed a professor abroad with an email outlining my general idea, asking questions about details of the science, and with the subject line along the lines of \"Fulbright fellowship to work you on &lt;subject&gt;\".

This requires them to enroll you in a special way that isn't a regular enrollment deferral. I believe they also need to get NSF approval, but that doesn't take long.\n",

      "      -pGRE: I studied for about 2-3 weeks and only took the test once (September) but if I were you, I'd take the pGRE in April of your Junior year to get a sense for it, and then study regularly through the summer. The practice exams are good indicators of the real test. I think that the test is fair, useful and intuitive. It's also fun. But you have to confidently move throughout the 100 multiple-choice questions in a short amount of time. The best way to practice is under test conditions.\n",

      "      <br/>\n",
      "      <br/>\n",
      "      -how many schools to apply to: I did not apply to very many schools as you can see (only six). But for the schools I did apply to, I spent about a week researching each school and making contact with professors via email and Skype. It is a question of application quality vs. quantity... you will be quite busy Senior Fall with courses and research, so it will be hard for you to balance this.\n",
      "      <br/>\n",
      "      <br/>\n",
      "      - Personal Statement: I recommend a work-focused statement. I wrote a short beginning paragraph which summarized my goals and motivations. The statement was then sectioned into headers: \"Research\", \"Academics\" etc... and I wrote a paragraph for each of my main projects. The sentences were about what I contributed to each project. The final paragraphs were specific to each school: which projects I was interested in joining and why, the contributions I was hoping to make, etc. I liked this version better than a personal essay because it directly discussed the technical problems I hope to solve. However, such a statement might be more like everybody else's.\n",

      "      <br/>\n",
      "      - Overall thoughts: First, I'm pretty advantaged in this process because I'm a white female US citizen experimentalist. This means that my relatively low pGRE score (72%) didn't stop my application from being considered at any school I applied to. Ultimately I could afford to gamble and use the time I could be studying for pGRE (and save money and time it costs to re-take the test) to work on my research. Beyond this initial advantage, I think what made my application competitive at even the top schools was 1) that I took the experiments I was applying for seriously. I researched them like it was my job until I thought up good questions and brainstormed initial solutions to current problems. Also, 2) I was not shy about talking with professors and discussing the current issues about their projects with them.\n",

      "      The market for hard condensed matter theorists is saturated. I would compare it to the state of string theory applicants 20 years ago. Switch to soft matter if you know what's good for you. My application to Caltech was tailored towards the quantum information angle, which is likely why I was admitted. Theory in general is difficult to get into, but if you want to do strongly correlated electron systems, holography in condensed matter, or topological order you'd better have extremely good qualifications.\n",

      "      Don't graduate early unless you have to. Use the extra time to develop connections, conduct more research (get published if you can), and APPLY FOR EXTERNAL FUNDING. Take graduate QFT if you can. I don't think a slightly higher GRE score would have helped me, nor a slightly higher overall GPA. If you want to be a theorist you should know the material and the current avenues of research like the back of your hand. Read recent publications and prove that you are capable of working at that level. That's about your only shot at getting into the top schools, particularly if you're a male theorist from a less than top ten university like I am. And seriously, having your own guaranteed funding source is like an automatic pass to any school you want to go to.\n",

      "      I applied to 21 places, and paid application fee upto $125 at some places (should not have had applied to Berkeley probably as I withdrew even before the results were in). It was expensive. But for me it was worth it. I never dreamt that I would get into so many great programs. I would have been happy at many of these places, but with the luxury I had been given, I have decided to attend MIT. I never dreamt of getting into MIT, if I had applied to a fewer places MIT probably would not have made my list. My prof. at MIT told that I was selected because of my unique background, and strong recommendations. Also, I found having a Master's did overall boost my chance for application. And  publication is perhaps the single most important factor in the application process, and I got very lucky in that regards. But it did teach me many important lessons.\n",

I added over 200 points and 40% to my score using a combination of that text and older exams. I never made it into the elusive 990 club, but you can evidently still get into some solid programs without that membership. This was a stressful and expensive process, but I am beyond excited to be attending UNC this fall. Good luck to those who are still waiting and congratulations to everyone else with green text in their profiles!\n",

It was a pretty difficult decision but I decided to leave physics and pursue the quant. bio program at Princeton. In the end I decided to weigh my decision most heavily on quality of research rather than the exact name of my Ph.D. And honestly, I'm super happy with my decision and am so excited to start my graduate career at Princeton in the fall.\n",

      "      I wanted to add though, for people in future years, that this process was tough and it was long but you will get through it.  I had three scenarios come up during the application season that sucked (and I'm sharing them because maybe you have them too and now you know you aren't allow): getting my PGRE scores back, getting rejected after an interview, and declining offers to schools I had interviewed at and really liked. After I got my PGRE scores back I almost gave up applying to graduate school this year but then I decided to push myself to still apply to some of the physics programs I was going to apply to and I also branched out and looked at programs that still had my field of research (biophysics) but didn't require the PGRE. Looking back on it, I am so glad I did this because not only did I get into a pretty good physics program (which just goes to show that the PGREs aren't everything), but I ended up going into a biophysics/quant. bio program instead of physics. Now as for the rejection after an interview, it sucks but just understand that if you have a couple of interviews then odds are you'll get at least one acceptance (I got 3/5 acceptances from interviews) and that you are good enough (if multiple schools thought you were good enough to interview then you are good enough to go there, it just might be a really competitive year with low funding so less acceptances). Finally, declining offers to places you like is hard, it feels like breaking up with someone. And it's also something you may feel like you can't talk about because your peers may not have multiple offers, so just know that other people also go through this and it's okay to feel sad about declining an offer. For me, I let myself feel sad for about a day and then I just focused on how excited I was about the program I accepted.\n",

The best edits I got were from friends who just started PhD programs, math, bio, whatever, and that had recently been through this process. Having professors, parents, or others read is less helpful since the specific demands and tone of a SOP is not going to be as fresh in their memories. Unless of course they've recently been on an admissions committee, in which case they are the ultimate resource for you. Even if you're a good writer, this process will tax you and make you get tunnel vision, missing obvious errors for no good reason. This is what friends are for.\n",

In many cases they have to wade through tons of spam from applicants, and if their patience for the whole thing is running low then it may only unfairly serve to mark you as over-eager, warranting a negative response. If you've established communication by some other means, like at an REU or through a mutual contact, then great job, that will go a long way. If you want to email them cold, then make it brief, state your interests, and ask if they are taking new advisees.\n",

I was hoping for the PGRE score far better (at least 850) than that I got. It was my first attempt and I had got some days for preparation. I did what I could. Not going to pay for any other standardized tests. These tests suck. The research papers are not that great but I have done my best even though the resources were very limited. I am doing very well in the field of teaching and one of my professors has told me that he has mentioned this in the recommendation letter. Hope that strengthens my application.\n",

      "      Comments: I think that the GRE score doesn't matter too much if you are shooting for middle tier schools, it matters a bit more if you are shooting top tier and don't have a lot of papers etc. I wish I had done research in the field that I wanted to do grad studies in but idk if that would've helped me too much. In the end I I got into my top choices in labs and programs through networking and emailing with the professors, etc. I think that that went a long way. It still seems a bit random to me who gets in where. The biggest take-away I have is that I am very grateful for the number of schools that I applied to and I am SO glad I didn't take people's advice about only applying to a couple (especially since I wasn't the strongest candidate in certain areas).\n",

    "#### Analysis)\n",
    "Some important things can be inferred from this data. First, all the plots have a slight downward trend. This means those accepted into the top schools like MIT and Stanford have higher scores than those at the bottom end like the University of Minnesota and Penn State. So top end schools either have stronger filter or the caliber of students that stick out in admissions have high scores as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, for most of the plots there is a distinction between those who get accepted and those who don't. People with high scores generally get in more than those with lower scores. This means your GPA, quantitative GRE score, physics GRE score, and written GRE score (those with a stronger distiction) all play an imporatant part in your application. However, since there is a strong overlap in the verbal GRE acceptance and rejection scores, one's verbal GRE isn't as important. This backs up the initial idea that the verbal GRE score doesn't help you once you are \"well\" enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, there is large variance due to the high standard deviation. This is expected as admission committees look at more than just test scores so you'd expect variations "

    "### Question 2) What are the distributions of physics subject exam scores for different schools?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people stress out over the physics subject exam (PGRE) as it is a test one can only take once or twice and yet, appears to hold a lot of weight in school admission. Let's see how important the PGE is and school's PGRE distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll take a look at six schools: MIT, Stanford, Cal Tech, Univ of Michigan, Univ of Maryland, and Penn State. Three at the top of the rankings, two in the mid teens, and the last one in the mid twenties. "

This should be reassuring to applying grad students. It can also be seen that the top programs have shifted rightward distributions so everyone who applies (regardless if they get in or not) tend to have high scores. This could be a self selection/removeal process, where those who feel they don't have a chance at getting in don't apply."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this assignment we were interested in what matters for admission into physics grad school. On the website www.physicsgre.com there is a forum where people can enter in their academic profile and update it as they get accepted or rejected into the grad schools they applied for. Each post within this forum is fairly well structured allowing us to extract the users data fairly easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we accessed the data we wanted to determine information trends in the top 25 schools, determined by US News ranking. We found there is a lot of variation in all the numerical quantities that determine who gets accepted or rejected (seen in large error bars of plot one). The PGRE distributions also show that there are large overlaps between those who get accepted and rejected. These point to the fact that there is much more to a person's application then their raw numbers. Their letters of recommendation, research experience, connections to department, and statement of purpose are probably much more important and aren't accounted for here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also while there isn't much of a difference between international vs domestic and men vs women applicants there is an interesting barrier in how they perform on the physics subject exam. This could be due to how the test is structured and possible different levels of preparation going into the exam that might benefit different groups more than others."
